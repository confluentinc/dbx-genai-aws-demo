The Outback Oatmeal was stale, the Austin Almond Biscotti tasted like cardboard, and don't even get me started on the Orchard Oasis - it was like eating a mouthful of sugar. The service? Non-existent. The 'staff' seemed more interested in their phones than helping customers. The store itself was a mess, with crumbs and spills everywhere. And don't even get me started on the limited hours - who closes at 6pm on a Saturday?! The Golden Gate Ginger and Tokyo Tidbits looked promising, but I wasn't about to waste my money after the first few bites. And what's with the Pearly Pies being displayed in a dirty case?

"""Absolutely appalling experience at Sweet Delights Cookie Co. in LA! The 'customer service' was non-existent, with a dismissive and unfriendly staff who seemed put off by my presence. The store itself was a mess, with crumbs and spills covering every surface. And don't even get me started on the 'extended hours' they claim to have - I showed up at 6pm on a Saturday and they were already closed. Location is also super inconvenient, tucked away in a sketchy alley in downtown LA. And the cookies? Overpriced and stale. Avoid this dump at all costs!"""	3000005	2024-06-06 18:42:59.522000
